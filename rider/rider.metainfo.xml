  <summary>Fast &amp; powerful, cross platform .NET IDE</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      Rider supports .NET Framework, the new cross-platform .NET Core, and Mono based projects. 
      This lets you develop a wide range of applications including .NET desktop applications, 
      services and libraries, Unity games, Xamarin apps, ASP.NET, and ASP.NET Core web applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rider provides 2200+ live code inspections, hundreds of context actions and refactorings brought 
      by ReSharper, and combines them with the IntelliJ platform's solid IDE features. Despite a heavy 
      feature set, Rider is designed to be fast and responsive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rider is available for a free 30-day evaluation. Monthly and yearly subscription options are available for
      companies and individual users.
